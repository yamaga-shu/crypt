# CBC(Cipher Block Chaining) mode

## description
**CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode** is a mode of operation for block ciphers. It enhances security by combining each plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block before encryption, using an XOR operation. This chaining process ensures that identical plaintext blocks produce different ciphertexts, making pattern detection difficult. An initialization vector (IV) is used for the first block to add randomness and prevent identical plaintexts from encrypting to the same ciphertext. CBC mode is widely used in data encryption to provide confidentiality and resistance to certain types of cryptanalysis.
